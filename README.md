# A Little about the project
  This is a project I have done as part of my university course.
  It is a client-server application that communicates with each other. The client side is written in Cpp and the server is in Python.
  
Essentially there are 3 major "protocols" that operate with each other in the project, a Registration protocol, a Reconnection protocol and a SendFile protocol.
